# Data from: Flexible females: nutritional state influences biparental cooperation in a burying beetle

<https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.s7h44j1f2>

This data file consists of a comma-separated values spreadsheet (.csv), which provides data on the effects of nutritional state on parental cooperation. Each line in the spreadsheet represents a pair.

*   pair_id – individual ID of the pair.

<!---->

*   f_treatment – female experimental treatment.
*   m_treatment – male experimental treatment.
*   f_mass_before_treatment – female mass before experimental treatment (g).
*   f_mass_after_treatment – female mass after experimental treatment (g).
*   m_mass_before_treatment – male mass before experimental treatment (g).
*   m_mass_after_treatment – male mass after experimental treatment (g).
*   carcass_mass – mass of the mouse carcass provided to the pair for breeding (g).
*   f_direct – number of scans spent providing direct care to the larvae by the female.
*   f_indirect – number of scans spent providing indirect care to the larvae by the female.
*   f_consume – number of scans spent consuming carrion by the female.
*   m_direct – number of scans spent providing direct care to the larvae by the male.
*   m_indirect – number of scans spent providing indirect care to the larvae by the male.
*   m_consume – number of scans spent consuming carrion by the male.
*   f_mass_after_breeding - female mass upon larval dispersal from the carcass (g).
*   m_mass_after_breeding - male mass upon larval dispersal from the carcass (g).
*   number_larvae – number of larvae that dispersed from the carcass.
*   average_larval_mass – the average larval mass of the brood upon dispersal from the carcass (g).
