# BIO515 datasets

This repository contains data intended for use by students in the Scientific Methodology for Biologists course at the University of Gothenburg (BIO515, P1, Autumn 2024).

Each folders contains the datasets, code and results (figures) expected to be reproduced by students. Below is a brief description of each dataset.

## 1_lambert_and_smiseth _2024
Link: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.s7h44j1f2 \
Test: Normality & independent t-test\
Aim: assess the normality of distribution of female/male/carcass masses and then do a t-test to see if the response variable is significantly different between conditions\
Comment: there are many response variables to work with

## 2_zhao_and_marler_2014 
Link: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.qd1g6 \
Test: Paired t-test\

Test: Indep. T-test\
Aim: tests for sexual differences\
Comment: some aggregation is required\

## 4_schuler_et_al_2020 
Link: https://zenodo.org/records/3901283 \
Test: Indep. T-test\
Aim: perform independent T-tests for zooplankton abundance or diversity (sheet 8) \
Comment: Marine science representation

## 5_zingg_et_al_2024 
Link: https://zenodo.org/records/11357752 \
Test: correlation\
Aim: calculate correlations between the modeled values and measured biodiversity values \
Comment:

## 6_gamboa_2024 
Link: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.wwpzgmsjc \
Test: correlation\
Aim: calculate correlations between bill size and ecological factors\

## 7_johnsen_et_al_2018 
Link: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.v2t6b \
Test: ANOVA & correlation \
Aim: Correlation between female/male telomere lengths? Between within-pair/extra-pair telomere lengths \
Comment: could use this dataset for a bunch of tests, though it is a bit complicated and we may need to merge tables
