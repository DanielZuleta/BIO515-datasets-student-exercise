# BIO515 datasets

This repository contains data intended for use by students in the Scientific Methodology for Biologists course (BIO515, P1, Autumn 2024) at the University of Gothenburg.

1.  Each folder contains the data, code, and results (figures\|tables) that students are expected to reproduce. Below is a brief description of each dataset (to be completed).

Test: ANOVA & correlation\
Aim: Correlation between female/male telomere lengths? Between within-pair/extra-pair telomere lengths\
Comment: could use this dataset for a bunch of tests, though it is a bit complicated and we may need to merge tables

## 8_Drake_Schultheis_2021

Link: <https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.25349/D9W02C>\
Test: 2-way ANOVA\
Aim: \
Comment:

## 9_Lane_2023

Link: <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.r7sqv9sh8>\
Test: Diversity index, correlations.\
Aim: This dataset provides 40 years of data on plant community composition in a tidal marsh, assessing long-term changes in species assemblages and cover across different decades.\
Comment: It requires some data wrangling from the students\

## 10_Dickson_et_al_2013

Link:<https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.984r37k>\
Test: ANOVA, correlations\
Aim: This dataset covers the responses of an early successional plant community to long-term fertilization, focusing on changes in species richness, biomass, and functional group composition.\
Comment:

## 11_Larissa_et_al_2019

Link:<https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.c0n737b>\
Test: Different options from t-test to correlation\
Aim: This dataset focuses on plant-bird interactions in the Andean forests, specifically regarding seed dispersal by frugivorous birds. It includes functional traits of both plants and birds, allowing for analysis of ecological roles within this system.\
Comment:It requires some data wrangling from the students\

## 12_Reynolds_2022

Link:<https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vdncjsxwf>\
Test: ANOVA and correlation\
Aim: This dataset studies how adjacent crop types (e.g., canola, wheat) influence pollinator communities in natural vegetation remnants.\
Comment:It requires some data wrangling from the students\

## 13_Lishawa_et_al_2024

Link:<https://zenodo.org/records/10473100>\
Test: ANOVA t-test\
Aim: This study tested the effects of different treatments on invasive cattail populations in wetlands. The treatments included biomass harvesting and the creation of aquatic connectivity channels, and they were compared against control plots. Data includes changes in plant, fish, macroinvertebrate, and amphibian populations, along with water quality data, to assess the impact of these treatments over two years.\

## 14_Dornelas_et_al_2024

Link:<https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1248484>\
Test: Correlations, temporal trends, linear regression\
Aim: This study quantifies patterns of temporal α diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal β diversity, measured as change in community composition, across taxa, biomes, and geographic regions.\

Link:<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.16100>\
Test: Clustering analysis, regression\
Aim: This study aims to evaluate how demographic diversity (DD) and demographic composition (DC) differ across temperate and tropical forests, and how these differences in demography relate to species richness, aboveground biomass (AGB), and carbon residence time.\
